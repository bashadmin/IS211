# IS211_Assignment13
IS211_Assignment13


The previous week wrapped up our 4 weeks looking into web technologies and how to build simple web-based backend. Your project will be based on this portion of the course, which you should have started working on already. In the next few weeks, we will round out some more programming and Python knowledge that will be useful for you in your following courses and career. This week we will go over what are known as recursive functions. Recursive functions are functions which do their computation in a way such that the function calls itself, repeatedly. In other words, the definition of the function is in terms of that function itself. This weekâ€™s assignment will have you implement a few of these recursive functions. This assignment will be on the lighter side, as you should be spending your time on your projects. Remember, if you are having any difficulties with your project, speak up, either through email or the discussion boards.
