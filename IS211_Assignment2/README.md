Required Content: Reading
This week will not have a section from our textbooks. Instead, we will be focusing on a handful of useful modules. Each module has a link to a page explaining what the module does and how to use it. 
The ‘datetime’ module helps deal with time and date calculations 
http://pymotw.com/3/datetime/
The ‘logging’ module makes it very easy to log errors and general output to the screen, log files and more. Very useful for debugging.

Please read this introduction to the module as well

Here is another tutorial https://realpython.com/python-logging/
The ‘urllib’ allows you to make simple HTTP requests (until the Wrapping it Up section). However, this standard package has mostly been replaced by the requests library. You can read this tutorial on how to use it https://realpython.com/python-requests/

https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
The ‘random’ module helps you generate random numbers (Make sure to only read up until the Permutations section)
The ‘argparse’ module helps you pass command line parameters to your python programs in an easy way. Here is a comprehensive tutorial https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/
https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html
The ‘pprint’ module, while not too important, is useful in printing out large dictionaries or lists that would otherwise not print out in a clean way
